Notes from: NerdFoundryGaming:  https://www.reddit.com/user/NerdFoundryGaming/

Protip, set up DNS entries via dnsmasq:

(from my ATT-passthru walkthrough https://imgur.com/a/Vv0fKe6)

address=/sub1.domain.com/192.168.1.50
address=/sub2.domain.com/192.168.1.51
address=/domain.com/192.168.1.52

The last one there is a catchall for the same domain, where the other 2 define for subdomains.

They should now resolve on your LAN, assuming your router is the DNS for the device.

Assuming the default CIDR/IP: http://192.168.1.1/advanced-dhcpdns.asp
